Here scripts to pre-process or clean (munge) data are stored.  The preprocessing scripts stored in `munge` will be executed sequentially when you call `load.project()`, so the filenames are in alphanumeric order to ensure they are run correctly using the prefix 'M1', 'M2', 'M...'

Prior to using the munge scripts, you must set up your work environment with the following code:
setwd('YourRootDirectory/Applications')
library(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()

Munge Contents:

M1_PesticideLoad_CA: Aggregates all pesticide use data of interest for the analysis period from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation Pesticide Use Reports. Modify the beginning of the script under '#User Inputs' to specify which chemicals you will analyze as well as your analysis period.

M2_AquaticHealthBenchmark_PTI_HC5: Wrangles toxicity data attained from the Pesticide Toxicity Index database. From the database, the script employs the most sensitive toxic concentration of fish, cladocerans, and benthic organisms. Source: Nowell, L. H. et al. Complex mixtures of dissolved pesticides show potential aquatic toxicity in a synoptic study of Midwestern U.S. streams. Sci. Total Environ. 613–614, 1469–1488 (2018).

M3_HUC8_CA_PesticideAquaticToxicity_minSTC: Calculates aquatic toxic loads at the hydrologic unit code 8 (HUC8) scale across California using the aquatic health benchmark derived from the Pesticide Toxicity Index database.
